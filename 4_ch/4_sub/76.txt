Not really an answer (I failed), but more of a note:
We have seen earlier how changing the order of the sub-queries
in an and impacts whether we receive an answer at all, or if
an infinite loop gets triggered, asf. I suspect that
recursive definitions will suffer quite a bit with the
'parallel' search as per this exercise.
