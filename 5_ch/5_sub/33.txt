factorial-alt has a line for save and restore env respectively, within
the 'false branch' stuff. Apart from that, and the re-ordering
of whether to handle n or the factorial call first, the code looks pretty similar.

Given this, I think the first version, factorial, is marginally
more efficient than factorial-alt, since the latter also does the env saves and restores.


[Checked online, and someone pointed out that the first version, factorial,
saves and restores argl, which factorial-alt doesn't do. Therefore, there is no difference
in efficiency, only a difference in order of operations and which register to save and restore.]
