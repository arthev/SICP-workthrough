The order is right-to-left.
The order of evaluation enters
in that construct-arglist reverses the operand-codes list.

To evaluate in left-to-right order, remove the reversal there.
To make the order of arguments in argl stay intact so other code works as expected,
reintroduce the reversal in some fashion.

Either by reversing the entire argl after making it,
or by using append instead of cons to construct it in-order.

Either way, the left-to-right approach is less efficient, because cons is simpler than append,
and the reversing at the end is extra 'machine code' which the right-to-left evaluation doesn't
introduce.
