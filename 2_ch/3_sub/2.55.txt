As mentioned in the text,
the 'something is really just a shorthand
for (quote something).

Since quoting something wouldn't work if doing
applicative-order evaluation of the somethings
first, the quote operator is clearly a special form.

So ''abracadabra is equivalent to (quote (quote abracadabra)).
This creates a list consisting of 'quote and 'abracadabra.
The car of which is 'quote, and the cdr of which is ('abracadabra).
