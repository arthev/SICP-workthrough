n ->  tp :  md
1 ->  16 :  08
2 ->  48 :  13
3 ->  80 :  18
4 -> 112 :  23
5 -> 144 :  28

Let's look at total-pushes first:
We see a diff of 32 per increase in n.
Therefore, we conjecture that
tp(n) = 32(n-1) + 16
tp(n) = 32n - 16

Let's look at max-depth:
We see an increase of 5 per increase in n.
Therefore, we conjecture that
md(n) = 5n + 3

Then, we would expect
tp(15) = 464
md(15) =  78


(factorial 15)
(total-pushes = 464 maximum-depth = 78)
