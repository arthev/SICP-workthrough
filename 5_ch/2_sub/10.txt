Probably.

I'll implement an instruction to decrement a register. That is, instead of having to write:
(assign R (op -) (reg R) (const 1))

I want to be able to simply use:
(dec R)

Plan: Add to dispatch, and then add some
functions to handle the implementation.
Hmm. Doesn't seem I'll have to modify
much except the actual dispatch...
