Without explicit handling of multiple definitions of the same label (i.e. error handling),
the content of the a register is 3 after execution of the simulation.

(Because when the simulator searches through for a 'here' label, it will
find the first textmost instance due to recursive build-up from bottom to top
in the extract-labels procedure.)
