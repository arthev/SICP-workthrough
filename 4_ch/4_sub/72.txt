Analogously to exercise 4.71...
There's the potential for infinite streams. 
By interleaving instead of appending, we're guaranteed
to receive the answer in full if one of the involved streams is finite
while the other is infinite.

E.g. stream-append works well if we can guarantee s1 is the finite and s2 is the infinite.
stream-interleave doesn't care about the order there.

Of course, infinite responses to the queries still presents their own problems.
But at least with the interleaving, you get more useful output than waiting on the one
infinite stream to finish -- even if both streams are infinite!
