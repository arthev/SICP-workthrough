Reasoners reasons wrongly: his solution leads to an infinite loop.

First the parser tries (parse-word verbs). If that doesn't work
out, it then tries (list 'verb-phrase (parse-verb-phrase) (parse-prepositional-phrase)).
But the first part of parse-verb-phrase is trying (parse-word verbs), so this simply builds
a recursive stack of attempts at parse-word with a growing number of a-waiting
attempts at the propositional parsing.

Same for if the order is reversed, since each (amb a0 a1)->a0 then will wait for 
the completion of all a0's above in the stack.
