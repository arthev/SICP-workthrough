# SICP-workthrough

This is a repository containing my answers to the exercises in Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs (SICP).
And a spreadsheet tracking hours and exercises, etc. 

I used MIT-scheme since the book was written for it, except for the 'picture language' chapter, where I temporarily
switched to Racket due to library availability.

There is a [particularly long-winded write-up on the workthrough here](https://abstractaway.com/learning-to-program-with-the-wizard-book-sicp-first-pass/). Perhaps primarily useful as my personal review of my own immediate experiences. But hey, there's some statistics in the post!
