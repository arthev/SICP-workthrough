(f 'x 'y)
All the saves and restores are superfluous, since this can be applied directly.

((f) 'x 'y)
All are superfluous:
No need to save and restore env around (f) because 'x and 'y are self-evaluating.

(f (g 'x) y)
Operator doesn't need evaluating.
But both of the operands do.
So only the save and restore of env around f is superfluous.

(f (g 'x) 'y)
No need to save and restore env because f and 'y are self-evaluating,
which means the interpretation can't change based on what (g 'x) does.
