The double listing, e.g.
(lives-near (A) (B))
(lives-near (B) (A))
occurs because lives-near is a symmetric relation, and therefore when
the query is carried out, it will find the pair A-B when searching with A as ?person-1,
and then later the pair B-A when searching with B as ?person-1.

It's possible to make all pairs list only once, e.g. by modifying the lives-near rule
to impart a partial order based on, say, alphabetical ordering.
e.g.
(rule (lives-near ?person1 ?person2)
	(and (address ?person1 (?town . ?rest1))
		 (address ?person2 (?town . ?rest2))
		 (not (same ?person1 ?person2))
		 (lisp-value ALPHABETICAL-LESSER-THAN ?person1 ?person2)))
