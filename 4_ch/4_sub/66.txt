Suppose Ben wants to find the average salary of
a company wheel.
Then he might use e.g.:
(average ?amount (and (wheel ?who)
                      (salary ?who ?amount)))

But as we have just seen, the wheel query can
list the same person several times. This would
screw up the calculation of the average.

In general, Ben has realized that he will
be accumulating non-unique frames.

To fix this, he can feed the result
stream through a function that creates
a new stream of unique frames, analogous to
distinct? as used in ch. 4.3, and then
run the uniqueified stream through the
accumulation function.
