A simple new syntax for scheme would be
postfix notation, so that e.g. (+ 1 2 3) instead becoms (1 2 3 +),
and (if P A B) becomes (P A B if).

This requires changing tagged-list so it checks the last element in an exp instead of the first.
And it requires changing the different data abstractions so that, e.g. old instances of cadr become car.
That is, everything 'moves' one slot to the left.
