When trying to run the code using the new-if,
scheme complains of the maximum recursion depth having been exceeded. 

This is because of the fact if is a special form: it evaluates the preciate,
and then evaluates one of the following combinations.

The call to new-if isn't a special form, but a normal procedure call.
This means that the interpreter tries to evaluate all the parameters...
And one of those calls the procedure recursively, leading to an 
infinitely growing stack of calls that never get evaluated because 
evaluating one requires adding another call atop it first.
